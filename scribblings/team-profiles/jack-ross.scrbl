 @blog-post["Day 16"]{
  A fascinating introduction to github and working with the terminal. We've created our bios and pushed them. I had a great sandwich from
  Judy's Cafe.

 @blog-post["Day 17"]{
  We pushed dummy texts and then reverted them. We've created a 2htdp image of Mike Wazowski and added them to our bios.
