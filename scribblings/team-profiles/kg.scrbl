DCog

I enjoyed learning about Distributed Cognition during the first day of internship. I felt the following website really helped me understand the topic. DCog is the idea that outside environments and rescources reinforce one's learning. An example of this would be flow states, in which a quiet, outdoor environment is more conducive to the formation of a flow of concentration.

Recognition vs. Recall vs. Fluency

Today, we learned about recall vs. recognition. We applied our knowledge of this by playing an ASL memory game. We learned that we were able to recall symbols that were either the most unique or relevant to use. Eventually, by playing the game for a few rounds, we were able to recognize more symbols. We also learned about how fluency is the highest level of recall.

Refactoring, Broca's Region, fMRI Studies

Refactoring is the process of reorganizing existing computer code without changing any external code. 
The Broca's Region is the area of the brain responsible for speech formation. It is located in the frontal lobe of the dominant hemisphere.
fMRI is a type of imaging that measures brain activity by detecting changes related to blood flow.
