@blog-post["Day 1"]{
  Learned about DCog and studied the Chinese room and Museum notebook thought expirements. I realized it's beneficial to distribute your cognitive load with your peers, your enviornment, or both!
}

@blog-post["Day 2"]{
  Learned the difference between recognition and recall. There isn't really a distnct difference, it's more of a spectrum. Learned ASL. I have recall over the letters in my name, but not much else.
}

@blog-post["Day 3"]{
  Learned about refactoring code. I saw the benefits of abstracted functions when we were able to streamline everyone's blog posts with a single function. Researched broca's region. Learned that learning programming is more like learning a forign language than doing math. I never would have thought about it that way!
