  I want to live in a world where everyone knows how to code.  I believe that coding ought to be a basic literacy for everyone.  I think the problems of the world today will only be solved by training an army of computational thinkers -- i.e. coders who are fluent in many languages, and also expert life-long learners, able to effortlessly wield modern science to optimize their own learning.  I think we cannot afford to live much longer in a world where the majority of people consume technology, but only a minority create it, and only a minority know how to wield it to make the world a better place.
