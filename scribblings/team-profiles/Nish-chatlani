I believe that one day, world peace can be achieved with communication and education through technology.
With fast-paced advancements from today's tech giants and geniuses we can improve the world and fix
environmental setbacks to mend the mistakes of the past.

@blog-post["Day 6"]{
On the first day of the Thuoghtstem Summer project, I learned a lot about distributed cognition (DCog), also referred to as
"Extended Mind".  We drew parallels between DCog and technology and how technology serves as storage that the mind once stored (e.g. phone numbers).
Furthermore, we learned the basics and the powers of the command terminal.  It was very informational and will be useful in the future.
