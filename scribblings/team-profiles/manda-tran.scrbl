@subsection{Distributed Cognition - 06/17/19}
Discussed the definition of distributed cognition as the mind not being limited to the individual.
It includes utilizing resources from the environment (artifacts and other people).
Distributed Cognition counters the traditional view that the mind is contained in the body.

@subsection{Recognition vs Recall - 06/18/19}
Talked about the distinction between recognition and recall. Recognition is a more shallow understanding
of a concept while recall requires a deeper understanding. We discussed this concept in terms of language
specifically how the English language has subsets that require futher fluency.
