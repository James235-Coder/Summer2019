;==== Googly Eye ===

; Easy: Make an eye from an outlined circle with a smaller solid black circle
; inside of it (the pupil). Make the eyes rotate counterclockwise over time.

(define-example-code Summer2019/Languages/my-game-lang/main rotating-eye

; TO-DRAW
(define (create-rotating-eye angle)
  (rotate angle eye))

; The eye sprite
(define eye (overlay/offset (circle 12 "solid" "black") 0 18
		    (circle 30 "outline" "black")))

;Medium: Make an eye with a pupil that rotates when the mouse is pressed in the window.

                           (circle 30 "outline" "black")))

;Hard: Make an eye with a pupil that rotates when the mouse is clicked on the eyeball.
;Hint: Use the distance formula! The center of the eye is located at 30 30.
;The radius of the eye is 30.

; Checks mouse input

; Checks if the mouse's posn is inside of the eye
(define (check-posn x y)
  (if (< (calc-distance x y 30 30) 30) #t #f))

; Distance formula
(define (calc-distance x1 y1 x2 y2)
  (sqrt (+ (sqr (- x2 x1)) (sqr (- y2 y1))))))

;Kata 4: Make an eye with pupils that follow the location of your mouse

;Hint: Remember your trigonomety! If you know the x and y distance between two points,
;you can find the angle between them. Use (atan y x), and remember that the signs of
;x and y matter!
