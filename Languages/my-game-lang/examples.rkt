;googly-eye

;Kata 1: Make an eye from an outlined circle with a smaller solid black circle
;inside of it (the pupil). Make the eyes rotate counterclockwise over time.

;Kata 2: Make an eye with a pupil that rotates when the mouse is pressed in the window.

;Kata 3: Make an eye with a pupil that rotates when the mouse is clicked on the eyeball.
;Hint: Use the distance formula! The center of the eye is located at 30 30.
;The radius of the eye is 30.

;Kata 4: Make an eye with pupils that follow the location of your mouse

;Hint: Remember your trigonomety! If you know the x and y distance between two points,
;you can find the angle between them. Use (atan y x), and remember that the signs of
;x and y matter!
